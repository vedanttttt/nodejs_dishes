# nodejs_dishes

This project is based upon backend-web-development and I made it while learning server side development with node.js and mongoDB.
It is basically a backend for a webiste for various famous dishes all over the world .

This project contains models for various dishes, authentication using webtokens,o-auth2.0 ,and a proper database for storing dishes on mongoDB.
